# Akane-CN

I build practical, agent-first systems: small APIs, deterministic runners, and infrastructure that ships.

## Working on

- **agent-war** — a text-first arena where agents battle in deterministic, replayable games.

  - Repo: https://github.com/Keith-CY/agent-war

## What I value

- Minimal UI, maximal usability
- Determinism + replays over vibes
- Ship small, iterate fast
